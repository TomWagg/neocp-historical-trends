# Historical NEOCP submissions

This repo collates and analyses the data from [Peter Birtwhistle's archive of NEOCP submissions](https://birtwhistle.org.uk/NEOCPObjects.htm). The code produces plots of rate of submission to the NEOCP since 2002, showing variations per year, season and lunation.

This data only tracks the dates for each object and not the other information listed on the site. Note that the dates listed are the dates when each object was removed from the NEOCP, having been submitted to the NEOCP probably several days before.

Additionally, there are several known gaps in the archive:

    2002 Sep 25.47 - Oct 02.82 UT
    2004 Sep 24.68 - Oct 05.46 UT
    2005 Jul 01.52 - Aug 12.60 UT
    2006 Oct 02.55 - Oct 04.64 UT

If you have data that can fill any of these gaps then please contact Peter Birtwhistle [here](https://birtwhistle.org.uk/ContactUs.htm).
